# Local Weather
A jQuery application that uses geolocation and the darksky.net API to display your local weather.

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and supply API keys from [darksky.net](https://darksky.net) and [Google](https://developers.google.com/maps/web-services/).

You can view it [here](http://www.justinclagg.com/local-weather/).
